## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting systemic crises across 13 African countries between 1860 and 2014. The aim is to build a machine learning model that can predict the emergence of a systemic crisis based on various economic indicators such as inflation rates, exchange rates, debt defaults, and more.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on banking, financial, inflation, and systemic crises from 1860 to 2014 in the following African countries: Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

### Dataset Columns:
- **country_number**: Numeric country identifier
- **country_code**: ISO code of the country
- **country**: Name of the country
- **year**: Year of observation
- **systemic_crisis**: Indicates whether a systemic crisis occurred (1: Yes, 0: No)
- **exch_usd**: Exchange rate against USD
- **domestic_debt_in_default**: Domestic debt in default
- **sovereign_external_debt_default**: External debt default
- **gdp_weighted_default**: GDP-weighted default rate
- **inflation_annual_cpi**: Annual inflation rate
- **independence**: Whether the country was independent in that year
- **currency_crises**: Occurrence of a currency crisis (1: Yes, 0: No)
- **inflation_crises**: Occurrence of an inflation crisis (1: Yes, 0: No)
- **banking_crisis**: Whether a banking crisis occurred (1: Yes, 0: No)

### Dataset Source: 
Kaggle - African Economic Crises Data Analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ezzaldin6/african-economic-crises-data-analysis)
### Dataset description : 
This dataset focuses on the Banking, Debt, Financial, Inflation and Systemic Crises that occurred, from 1860 to 2014, in 13 African countries, including: Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a systemic crisis in any of the 13 African countries using various economic features from the dataset.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Importation & Exploration**: Load the data and understand its structure using Pandas Profiling.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Model Selection & Training**: Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Model Improvement Techniques**: Use feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to improve model performance.

## Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values
No missing values were detected in the dataset.

### Handling Duplicates
Duplicates were checked and removed using `df.drop_duplicates()`.

### Outlier Detection and Treatment
Outliers in **exch_usd** (exchange rate) and **gdp_weighted_default** were detected using box plots and scatter plots. Winsorization and Z-score techniques were used to handle extreme values while preserving data integrity.

### Encoding Categorical Features
Label Encoding was applied to categorical columns like **country_code**, **country**, and **banking_crisis** using `LabelEncoder`.

---

## Modeling

### Train-Test Split
The data was split into training and testing sets:
- **Features**: All columns except `systemic_crisis`.
- **Target**: `systemic_crisis`.

The split was 80% for training and 20% for testing.

### Model Selection
We selected **RandomForestClassifier** as the initial model due to its robustness in handling various feature types and its ability to manage class imbalance.

### Model Performance Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: 96.34%
- Precision, Recall, and F1-scores were evaluated for both positive and negative classes, with good performance noted across the board, especially in detecting systemic crises.

---

## Model Improvement Techniques

### Feature Selection
RandomForest-based feature importance was used to select the most relevant features, improving model interpretability.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
We used **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune hyperparameters of the Random Forest model to find the best parameters.

### Cross-Validation
**StratifiedKFold** cross-validation was used to maintain class balance during training and validation.

### Handling Class Imbalance
**SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was applied to address class imbalance, especially for under-represented classes.

### Trying Different Algorithms
We also experimented with other models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

RandomForest outperformed both models in terms of accuracy and handling class imbalance.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository** and install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
2. **Download the dataset** from Kaggle.
3. **Run the main notebook or script** to execute the data analysis and model training.
4. **Review the output** for performance metrics, visualizations, and predictions.

## Real-World Applications
- **Early Warning Systems**: Governments can anticipate crises using these models, adjusting policies proactively.
- **Policy Decision-Making**: Central banks may adjust inflation targeting or currency controls based on model insights.
- **Investment Risk Assessment**: Investors can make informed decisions based on the predicted likelihood of financial crises.
- **Credit Rating Agencies**: Credit assessments can be improved by factoring in these predictions.
- **International Aid Allocation**: Organizations like the IMF can allocate resources proactively to countries at risk.

## Conclusion
- The RandomForest model achieved a high accuracy of 96.34% and performed well across precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Class imbalance remains a challenge, but techniques like SMOTE helped improve the modelâ€™s ability to detect minority-class instances.
- The predictive model offers valuable insights for early warning systems and economic policy decisions in African countries.This project has real-world implications for policy-making, risk assessment, and economic stability in African countries.

## Future Work
- Further optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Experiment with advanced techniques for handling class imbalance, such as undersampling or custom loss functions.
- Explore neural network models for potentially better predictions.
